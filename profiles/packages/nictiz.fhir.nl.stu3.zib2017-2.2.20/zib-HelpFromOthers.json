Their efforts enable the patient to function more or less independently. This includes not only caregivers, but also professional help such as that offered by home care organizations, nurses, aids and helpers. Current doctors and staff from the facility to which a patient is admitted do not fall under this concept.","purpose":"Information on help from others can provide a good estimate of the availability of the care required by the patient.
