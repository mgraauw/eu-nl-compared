It is part of the nursing process; interventions are determined as a result of indexed healthcare problems (nursing diagnoses) and based on treatment goals. The interventions are outlined in the nursing procedures.\r\nIn a home care situation some actions can also be performed by the patient or a caregiver after a relevant instruction.","purpose":"The nursing interventions are an essential part of the nursing process. A nursing intervention is recorded to document the nursing policy and to update other health professionals on the intervention. The documentation of nursing interventions offers the option to determine whether the interventions outlined in the treatment plan have been carried out. This way, we can facilitate optimal nursing and continuity of care.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-outcomeofcare-v3.2-2018EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/OutcomeOfCare-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM OutcomeOfCare-v3.1 (2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-nursingintervention-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/NursingIntervention-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM NursingIntervention-v3.1(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-healthprofessional-v3.2-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/HealthProfessional-v3.2(2017EN)","name":"HCIM HealthProfessional-v3.2(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-healthprofessional-v3.0-2016EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/HealthProfessional-v3.0(2016EN)","name":"HCIM HealthProfessional-v3.0(2016EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-healthprofessional-v1.2.1-2015EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/HealthProfessional-v1.2.1(2015EN)","name":"HCIM HealthProfessional-v1.2.1(2015EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Procedure","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Procedure","derivation":"constraint","snapshot":{"element":[{"id":"Procedure","path":"Procedure","short":"NursingIntervention","definition":"An action that is or was performed on a patient.
