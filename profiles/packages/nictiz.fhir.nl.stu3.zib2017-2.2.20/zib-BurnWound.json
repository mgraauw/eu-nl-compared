This ‘rule of nines’ cannot be used for children because a child’s body proportions are different from those of an adult. For children, separate tables were developed per age group to determine the extent of burn wounds. Another option is measuring the extent using the patient’s hand surface area. The surface area of a patient’s hand (including the fingers) equals approximately 1% of their total body surface area.","alias":["Uitgebreidheid"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.7","comment":"Extent"}]},{"id":"Condition.code","path":"Condition.code","short":"BurnWound","definition":"Indication of the kind of the burn wound, differentiated into the cause of the injury.","alias":["Brandwond"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.1","comment":"BurnWound"}]},{"id":"Condition.code.extension","path":"Condition.code.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Condition.code.extension:burnType","path":"Condition.code.extension","sliceName":"burnType","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-BurnWound-BurnWoundType"}]},{"id":"Condition.code.extension:burnType.valueCodeableConcept:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Condition.code.extension.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"BurnType","definition":"Indication of the kind of the burn wound, differentiated into the cause of the injury.","alias":["BrandwondSoort"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.9","comment":"BurnType"}]},{"id":"Condition.code.coding","path":"Condition.code.coding","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"Condition.code.coding:BurnWoundCode","path":"Condition.code.coding","sliceName":"BurnWoundCode","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Condition.code.coding:BurnWoundCode.system","path":"Condition.code.coding.system","min":1,"fixedUri":"http://snomed.info/sct"},{"id":"Condition.code.coding:BurnWoundCode.code","path":"Condition.code.coding.code","min":1,"fixedCode":"125666000"},{"id":"Condition.code.coding:BurnWoundCode.display","path":"Condition.code.coding.display","defaultValueString":"Brandwond"},{"id":"Condition.bodySite","path":"Condition.bodySite","short":"AnatomicalLocation","definition":"The location of the burn wound on the body.","alias":["AnatomischeLocatie"],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"BrandwondAnatomischeLocatieCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.4.2--20171231000000","display":"ProbleemAnatomischeLocatieCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.4","comment":"AnatomicalLocation"}]},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension:Laterality","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension","sliceName":"Laterality","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/BodySite-Qualifier"}]},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension:Laterality.valueCodeableConcept:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"Laterality","definition":"Laterality adds information about body side to the anatomic location, e.g. left","alias":["Lateraliteit"],"binding":{"strength":"required","description":"BrandwondLateraliteitCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.4.4--20171231000000"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.10","comment":"Laterality"}]},{"id":"Condition.subject","path":"Condition.subject","type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-patient"}]},{"id":"Condition.onset[x]","path":"Condition.onset[x]","short":"DateOfOnset","definition":"Date on which the burn wound appeared.","alias":["OntstaansDatum"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.3","comment":"DateOfOnset"}]},{"id":"Condition.stage","path":"Condition.stage","min":1},{"id":"Condition.stage.summary","path":"Condition.stage.summary","short":"Depth","definition":"Description of the severity of the burn wound, ranging from degree 1 - 3.","alias":["Dieptegraad"],"min":1,"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"DieptegraadCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.4.1--20171231000000","display":"DieptegraadCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.2","comment":"Depth"}]},{"id":"Condition.note","path":"Condition.note","short":"Comment","definition":"Comment on the burn wound.","alias":["Toelichting"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.5","comment":"Comment"}]}]}}
