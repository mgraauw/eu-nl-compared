This situation can be described by the person involved (the patient) themselves (in the form of a complaint), or by their healthcare provider (in the form of a diagnosis, for example). The situation can form cause for diagnostic or therapeutic policy.\r\n\r\nA problem includes all kinds of medical or nursing information that represents a health problem. A problem can represent various types of health problems:\r\n \r\nA complaint, finding by patient: a subjective, negatively experienced observation of the patient’s health. Examples: stomach ache, amnesia\r\n\r\nA symptom: an observation by or about the patient which may indicate a certain disease. Examples: fever, blood in stool, white spots on the roof of the mouth;\r\n\r\nA diagnosis: medical interpretation of complaints and findings. Examples: Diabetes Mellitus type II, pneumonia, hemolytic-uremic syndrome.\r\n\r\nA functional limitation: a reduction of functional options. Examples: reduced mobility, help required for dressing.\r\n\r\nA complication: Every diagnosis seen by the healthcare provider as an unforeseen and undesired result of medical action. Examples: post-operative wound infections, loss of hearing through the use of antibiotics.","purpose":"This Condition resource represents the Dutch [zib ('Zorginformatiebouwsteen', i.e. Health and Care Information Model) Problem v4.4 (2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/Problem-v4.4(2020EN)).","copyright":"Copyright and related rights waived via CC0, https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.
