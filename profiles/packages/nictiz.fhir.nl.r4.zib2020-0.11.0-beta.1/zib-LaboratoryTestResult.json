Guidance on use for singular tests and panels**\r\n\r\nThe zib LaboratoryTestResult captures both singular laboratory tests and panels/clusters of multiple related tests requested together (e.g. blood gases and EBV serology)*. This profile should be used slightly different in these two situations:\r\n\r\n* For singular laboratory test results\r\n    * A single instance of this profile is to be used.\r\n    * `Observation.code` represents zib concept TestCode (NL-CM:13.1.8, the name and code of the executed test) while zib concept PanelOrBattery (NL-CM:13.1.4, the name and code of the compound test) is not expected to be present.\r\n    * `Observation.status` represents zib concept TestResultStatus (NL-CM:13.1.31, the status of the test result). ResultStatus (NL-CM:13.1.6) is redundant in this situation and not expected to be present.\r\n* For a panel or cluster:\r\n    * There is a single instance for the overall result plus an instance for each individual test result.\r\n    * The concepts Comment (NL-CM:13.1.5, `Observation.note`), ResultType (NL-CM:13.1.7, `Observation.category:resultType`) and Performer (NL-CM:13.1.35, `Observation.performer`) are repeated in the instance for the overall result and in all instances for the individual test results.\r\n    * For the instance representing the overall result:\r\n      * `Observation.code` represents zib concept PanelOrBattery (NL-CM:13.1.4, the name and code of the compound test), which is required for panels/clusters.\r\n      * `Observation.status` represents zib concept ResultStatus (NL-CM:13.1.6, the overall status of the test result). This status should be in accordance with the statuses of each individual test.\r\n      * The instances representing the individual test results are referenced using `Observation.hasMember:laboratoryTest`.\r\n    * For the instances representing the individual test results:\r\n      * `Observation.code` represents zib concept TestCode (NL-CM:13.1.8, the name and code of the executed test) for that particular test.\r\n      * `Observation.status` represents zib concept TestResultStatus (NL-CM:13.1.31, the status of the test result) for that particular test.\r\n\r\nNote 1: The zib also recognizes the RelatedResult concept (NL-CM:13.1.33). This is unrelated to the use of panels/clusters. This concept is represented using `Observation.extension:sequelTo`.\r\n\r\n**2. Unmapped zib concepts**\r\n\r\n* The zib concept Requester (NL-CM:13.1.34) is not implemented because it is deemed unimplementable as-is. It will be removed in the next version of the zib (see <https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1269> for more information).\r\n* The zib concept InterpretationMethod (NL-CM:13.1.30) is not implemented because there's no obvious mapping to FHIR while the definition is problematic and there doesn't seem to be a use case for exchanging this information (see <https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1292> for more information).","alias":["Vital Signs","Measurement","Results","Tests","LaboratoriumUitslag","LaboratoriumTest"],"min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Observation","min":0,"max":"*"},"constraint":[{"key":"dom-2","severity":"error","human":"If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources","expression":"contained.contained.empty()","xpath":"not(parent::f:contained and f:contained)","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource"},{"key":"dom-4","severity":"error","human":"If a resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT have a meta.versionId or a meta.lastUpdated","expression":"contained.meta.versionId.empty() and contained.meta.lastUpdated.empty()","xpath":"not(exists(f:contained/*/f:meta/f:versionId)) and not(exists(f:contained/*/f:meta/f:lastUpdated))","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource"},{"key":"dom-3","severity":"error","human":"If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL be referred to from elsewhere in the resource or SHALL refer to the containing resource","expression":"contained.where((('#'+id in (%resource.descendants().reference | %resource.descendants().as(canonical) | %resource.descendants().as(uri) | %resource.descendants().as(url))) or descendants().where(reference = '#').exists() or descendants().where(as(canonical) = '#').exists() or descendants().where(as(canonical) = '#').exists()).not()).trace('unmatched', id).empty()","xpath":"not(exists(for $id in f:contained/*/f:id/@value return $contained[not(parent::*/descendant::f:reference/@value=concat('#', $contained/*/id/@value) or descendant::f:reference[@value='#'])]))","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bestpractice","valueBoolean":true},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bestpractice-explanation","valueMarkdown":"When a resource has no narrative, only systems that fully understand the data can display the resource to a human safely.
